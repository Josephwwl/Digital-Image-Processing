# Digital-Image-Processing
This is a group project focusing on processing videos and images using Python and OpenCV. It is separated into 2 parts:

# Part A
We are tasked with automating video editing processes for a friend who has recently embarked on a YouTube career. The requirements were:
- Blur people's faces in the video
- Add an overlay of her talking on the top left of the video
- Add watermarks

# Part B
We are asked to assist a senior colleague who is working on a literature review project. They have collected scientific papers in various formats, converted them into images, and need our help in extracting paragraphs. Our tasks involve:
- Identify and extract all the paragraphs from the papers he collected
- Sort them in the correct order
- Ignore tables in the papers
